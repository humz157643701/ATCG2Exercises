Prerequisites:
	Assimp Library
		A zip file containing the library's master branch can be found in the libs directory.
		
		The library must be compiled and installed on the system.
		Make sure that the binaries and the lib files are in the system path.
		Also make sure to build Assimp in release configuration and for the
		same architecture as the test application (x86, x86_64 ...)

		Because the CMake config files of Assimp are a little bit .. off..,
		they only return the file name of the library and not the complete path.
		If the library files are not in the system path or otherwise visible
		to the linker, it gets very unhappy.
	
	Some system that is able to run OpenGL 4.4

Build:
	Just run CMake from this directory and choose a generator that seems appropriate for the system.
	Compile the application using the generated makefiles.

Run:
	Run the application either from this directory or copy it somewhere else together with
	the assets directory. It has to see the asset directory, otherwise it will
	report an error. (or crash, if I missed something)
